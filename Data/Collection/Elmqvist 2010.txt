Abstract—We present a model for building, visualizing, and interacting with multiscale representations of information visualization
techniques using hierarchical aggregation. The motivation for this work is to make visual representations more visually scalable and
less cluttered. The model allows for augmenting existing techniques with multiscale functionality, as well as for designing new
visualization and interaction techniques that conform to this new class of visual representations. We give some examples of how to use
the model for standard information visualization techniques such as scatterplots, parallel coordinates, and node-link diagrams, and
discuss existing techniques that are based on hierarchical aggregation. This yields a set of design guidelines for aggregated
visualizations. We also present a basic vocabulary of interaction techniques suitable for navigating these multiscale visualizations.
