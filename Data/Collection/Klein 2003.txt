Abstract
This paper presents a new framework for Metadata
Visualisation Systems called VisMeB (Visual Metadata
Browser). It is based upon redesign ideas from the INSYDER1
System that were come under extensive evaluations.
The aim of our approach is to improve the process
of finding relevant information in an intuitive yet multifunctional
way. We use a ScatterPlot in combination with a so
called SuperTable for visualisation. The two techniques are
tightly coupled and present unique possibilities of interaction
through the use of visual filters.
1. Introduction
In the field of Information Visualisation and Visual Data
Mining a lot of effort has been spent on inventing new visualisations
that utilize the human visual capabilities [9], [18].
The goals of the research project VisMeB (Visual Metadata
Browser) presented in this paper are to support users
in finding relevant data and to enhance the possibilities of
browsing and filtering an information space. To achieve
these goals, our system makes use of different visualisations.
Our thesis is that users will benefit in terms of effectiveness,
efficiency and satisfaction[8] from our Visual
Metadata Browser compared with common list or tablebased
presentations.
This thesis is not undisputed, as our own work has shown.
The preceeding visual information seeking system INSYDER
has been evaluated with an usability test (n=40) -
see[13]. As a main result the traditional result list presentation
has beaten the visualisations (e.g. bar charts, tile
bars, scatterplot). In the these tests the different visualisations
that were offered turned out to confuse the user. The
users were overwhelmed by the presentation of the different
alternative views. Thus, they frequently decided to use
