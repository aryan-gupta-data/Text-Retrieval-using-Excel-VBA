This paper describes a novel methodfor the visualization
of hierarchically structured information. The Tree-Map
visualization technique makes 100% use of the available
display space, mapping the full hierarchy onto a rectangular
region in a space-filling manner. This efficient use of space
allows very large hierarchies to be displayed in their entirety
and facilitates the presentation of semantic information.
