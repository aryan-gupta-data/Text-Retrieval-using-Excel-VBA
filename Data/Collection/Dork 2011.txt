Abstract
In this work, we describe how EdgeMaps provide a new method for integrating the visualization of explicit and
implicit data relations. Explicit relations are specific connections between entities already present in a given
data set, while implicit relations are derived from multidimensional data based on similarity measures. Many
data sets include both types of relations, which are often difficult to represent together in information visualizations.
Node-link diagrams typically focus on explicit data connections while not incorporating implicit
similarities between entities. Multidimensional scaling considers similarities between items; however, explicit
links between nodes are not displayed. In contrast, EdgeMaps visualize both explicit and implicit relations
by combining graph drawing and spatialization techniques. We have applied this technique to three case
studies (philosophers, painters, and musicians) and explored how integrated visualizations of explicit and
implicit relations reveal novel patterns and relationships.
