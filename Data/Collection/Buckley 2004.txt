Observations from a unique investigation of failure analysis of Information
Retrieval (IR) research engines are presented. The Reliable
Information Access (RIA) Workshop invited seven leading
IR research groups to supply both their systems and their experts
to an effort to analyze why their systems fail on some topics and
whether the failures are due to system flaws, approach flaws, or the
topic itself. There were surprising results from this cross-system
failure analysis. One is that despite systems retrieving very different
documents, the major cause of failure for any particular topic
was almost always the same across all systems. Another is that
relationships between aspects of a topic are not especially important
for state-of-the-art systems; the systems are failing at a much
more basic level where the top-retrieved documents are not reflecting
some aspect at all.
