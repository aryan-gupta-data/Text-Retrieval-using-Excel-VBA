Abstract. Researchers and users of Information Visualization are convinced
that it has value. This value can easily be communicated to others
in a face-to-face setting, such that this value is experienced in practice.
To convince broader audiences, and also, to understand the intrinsic
qualities of visualization is more difficult, however. In this paper we consider
information visualization from different points of view, and gather
arguments to explain the value of our field.
1 Problems and Challenges
This paper provides a discussion of issues surrounding the value of Information
Visualization (InfoVis). The very existence of the paper should alert the reader
that challenges do exist in both recognizing and communicating the field’s value.
After all, if the value would be clear and undisputed, there would be no need
to write the paper! Unfortunately, the current situation is far from that. By its
very focus and purpose, InfoVis is a discipline that makes the recognition of
value extremely difficult, a point that will be expanded below.
