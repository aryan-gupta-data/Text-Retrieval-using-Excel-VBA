Introduction to Human-Centered
Visualization Environments
Andreas Kerren, Achim Ebert, and J¨org Meyer
The title of this book—Human-Centered Visualization Environments (HCVE)—
is composed of two key components: “human-centered” and “visualization environments”.
While the first part refers to the research area of Human-Computer
Interaction (HCI), the second one refers to the design of Visualization systems.
Thus, the focus of this textbook is on the intersection of both fields. These two
terms can be defined as follows:
Visualization can be defined as: “The use of computer-supported, interactive,
visual representation of abstract data to amplify cognition.” [145]. The aim
of visualization is to aid people in understanding and analyzing data. While
other subfields, such as Scientific Visualization (SciVis), involve the presentation
of data that has some physical or geometric correspondence, Information
Visualization (InfoVis) centers on abstract information without such
correspondences, i.e., usually it is not possible to map this information into
the physical world. In this textbook, the focus is mainly on InfoVis.
Human-Computer Interaction is “the study of interaction between people (users)
and computers. It is an interdisciplinary subject, relating computer science
with many other fields of study and research. Interaction between users
and computers occurs at the user interface (or simply interface), which includes
both software and hardware, for example, general purpose computer
peripherals and large-scale mechanical systems such as aircraft and power
plants.” [895]. The aim of HCI research is to improve the interaction between
users and computers in the sense that this interaction should become more
user-friendly and better adapted to the needs of the users.
