Modern object-oriented programs are hierarchical systems with
many thousands of interrelated subsystems. Visualization helps developers
to better comprehend these large and complex systems.
This work presents a three-dimensional visualization technique that
represents the static structure of object-oriented software using distributions
of three-dimensional objects on a two-dimensional plane.
The visual complexity is reduced by adjusting the transparency of
object surfaces to the distance of the viewpoint. An approach called
Hierarchical Net is proposed for a clear representation of the relationships
between the subsystems.
