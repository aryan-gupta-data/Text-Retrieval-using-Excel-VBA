The growing use of information visualization tools and data mining algorithms
stems from two separate lines of research. Information visualization researchers
believe in the importance of giving users an overview and insight into the data
distributions, while data mining researchers believe that statistical algorithms
and machine learning can be relied on to find the interesting patterns. This
paper discusses two issues that influence design of discovery tools: statistical
algorithms vs visual data presentation, and hypothesis testing vs exploratory
data analysis. The paper claims that a combined approach could lead to novel
discovery tools that preserve user control, enable more effective exploration,
and promote responsibility.
