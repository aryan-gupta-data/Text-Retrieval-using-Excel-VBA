Task-models are user-centered representations of goals and actions a
user needs to perform in the context of information processing. They help to
characterize tasks which might be fruitfully supported by current or future systems
and therefore are promising aids for a deeper understanding of user activities
in certain application domains. This paper presents a taxonomy for document
analysis tasks which are relevant in particular in knowledge management
and can potentially be aided by visual text-access technology. The task-model is
developed in three steps: Selected domain-independent task-models from literature
are condensed to form a theoretical basis for the development of a specialized
model. Case studies concerned with different document analysis tasks as
well as results of a survey in knowledge-intensive industries complete and optimize
the specialized task-model for document analysis in knowledge management.
