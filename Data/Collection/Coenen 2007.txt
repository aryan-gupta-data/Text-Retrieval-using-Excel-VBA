Purpose – To provide a technical and practical analysis of the interactive floor plan developed by
and for the law library at the Catholic University of Leuven, Belgium.
Design/methodology/approach – The different steps in the development process are described,
from original idea to conclusion.
Findings – Though some steps in the process are described fairly technically and detailed, the paper
is by no means a step-by-step guide to developing similar applications, it briefly touches the principles
and concepts that make the application work.
Originality/value – This paper describes the conception and development of a new type of library
application. A truly interactive floor plan, unlike traditional static floor plans found on most web sites,
was developed to create an actual virtual library. The concepts and techniques described in this paper
could prove useful for other libraries wanting to create a similar application.
