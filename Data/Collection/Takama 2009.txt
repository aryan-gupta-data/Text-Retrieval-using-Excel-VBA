Abstract
This paper proposes the visualization cube for modeling
interaction in exploratory analysis of spatiotemporal
trend information. Recent growth of the Web has
brought us various type of information, among which
trend information is one of the important information,
because it is crucial for our decision making. Although
interactive information visualization system is useful
for supporting exploratory data analysis of trend information,
the design of such systems tends to depend
on the idea of each designer. It is expected that establishing
adequate interaction model will contribute to
the design of those systems. The visualization cube
defines the abstract data structure of spatiotemporal
trend information, which consists of 4 axes: spatial,
temporal, statistics-value, and type-of-views axes. Interactions
for generating views for analytic purpose
are defined as the operations on it. Based on the interaction
model, the prototype system is developed and
used in actual classes of an elementary school, of
which the result shows the system has enough usability
for 5th-grade elementary school students to perform
exploratory data analysis. It is expected the visualization
cube contributes to the design of interactive information
visualization systems.
