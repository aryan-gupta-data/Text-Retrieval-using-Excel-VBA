red and white lines represent
patriotism,” “The red and white
lines represent a landscape,”
”The red and white lines represents
amber waves of grain,”
“The blue circle represents sky,”
“The center of the circle represents
a sun rising,” “A sun rising
represents change,” and so on.
Based on this list of propositions
alone, a rough estimate of
PD for the logo is PD ˜ 10 / 3 ˜
3.33, a very high propositional
density. Additionally, the propositions
are positive and complementary,
creating a synergistic
effect. The rendering is simple,
but the meaning runs deep—a
primary reason for the logo’s
appeal and effectiveness.
Propositional density explains
the benefit of incorporating
emergent elements like the
arrow in the FedEx logotype
and the sunrise in the Obama
logo. Normally, the cost of additional
propositions is additional
elements, which of course
means additional complexity.
However, incorporating emergent
elements and Gestalt-type
effects enables a designer to
add deep propositions without
adding elements. In design, it is
the closest thing to a free lunch
as you can get.
Let’s look at a product-design
example, the Hug salt and
pepper shakers. The surface
propositions are: “One shaker
is black,” “One shaker is white,”
“The shakers are anthropomorphic,”
and “The shakers
appear to be hugging.” The deep
propositions are: “The white
shaker represents salt,” “The
black shaker represents pepper,”
“The shakers represent
people of different races living
in harmony,” “The shakers represent
the idea that opposites
its presence is a function of
negative space created by the
physical elements in the design,
yet it expresses a number of
propositions: “Federal Express
is on the go,” “Federal Express
is forward thinking,” “Federal
Express has direction,” and so
on. Note that these propositions,
unlike surface propositions,
are highly dependent on
the meaning that the observer
ascribes to the arrow. These
are called “deep propositions,”
because they describe underlying
and often hidden meanings
of elements.
The propositional density of
any design can be estimated
by dividing the number of
deep propositions by the number
of surface propositions.
Mathematically:
PD ˜ Pd / Ps
where:
PD is propositional density,
Pd is the number of deep propositions,
and
Ps is the number of surface
propositions.
Note that PD can be estimated
only because the number
of deep propositions is variable
across observers.
Objects and environments
with high PD are more interesting
and engaging than objects
and environments with low PD.
Simple objects and environments
(i.e., few surface propositions)
that are rich in meaning
(many deep propositions) are
perceived to be the most compelling,
especially when the
propositions are complementary.
Though the specific thresholds
have not yet been determined
empirically, successful designs
commonly have PD > 1, which is
a good benchmark to consider
when applying the principle.
Consider, for example, the
much heralded logo of Barack
Obama’s 2008 presidential
campaign. The logo expresses
essentially three surface propositions:
“The logo contains a
blue circle,” “The logo contains
red and white lines,” and “The
red and white lines cut horizontally
across the lower half of
the circle.” The number of deep
propositions expressed, by contrast,
is quite large: “The circle
represents an O for Obama,”
“The circle represents unity,”
“The circle represents stability,”
“The red and white lines represent
the American flag,” “The
